# MachineCurveExtraction


**Extraction of Performance Curves for Model and Prototype Machines**
- The aim of this project is developing a Python code to generate prototype machine characteristic curves from model compressor or turbine curves for different conditions, which is very practical for compressors.

- For this code you need to have an excel file like that provided to extract model data.
